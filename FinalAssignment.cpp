    *will clarify with Sherine
    FinalAssignment tasks:
    object for main will be hash
    1. Hash table comprising of Open hasing with chaining (I-VI) and Linear probing (VII-XII)
    2. Word ranking the top 80 words by occurences (most and least). Capitalization does not matter
        and Double hyphen "--" must be removed. All outputs are streamed to a file from command line
        argument. 
    3. In IX, user must be prompt to do a word search, and use the Rabin-Karp pattern matching
        and Horner's rule for the rolling hash. Display the word count and positions of the word 
        from the user.
    4. Develope the main function that is menu driven (0) to terminate and (99) to output everything. 
        This will take in a command line argument of the input file and output file.
    5. Demo presenter when assignment is turned in and is responsible for turning in the assignment.
    
    For each task, these must be reported:
        1. Occupency Ratio. Report runtime in nanosec*
        2. Open hashing - chain length optimality. 
            Report 3 experiments and runtime in nanosec*
        3. What hash function was used? Report 3 different 
            experiements and runtime in nansec
        4. Collision Resolutions (must use method from lectures)
        5. Did you use a .h file to achive the tasks?
        6. Make sure to label your section when outputing to the file
        7. Everything will be output lower case except for Section title
