    FinalAssignment tasks:
    
    Update: readfile is now much shorter and less complecated. This task was
    done my Abraham Avila. sentence counting is done

    object for main will be hash_"method"
    *1. (Abraham) Hash table comprising of Open hasing with chaining (I-VI) 

        1. Answer (b) and (c) in assignment spec  

    *2. (Ari) Linear probing (VII-XII)

        1. Answer question (a), (c), and (d) in assignment spec

    *3. (Connor) In IX, user must be prompt to do a word search, and use the Rabin-Karp pattern
        matching and Horner's rule for the rolling hash. Display the word count and positions 
        of the word from the user. This covers (f) in the assignment spec

    *4. (Ari)Word ranking the top 80 words by occurences (most and least). Capitalization does not matter
        and Double hyphen "--" must be removed. All outputs are streamed to a file from command 
        line argument. This covers (g) and (h) assignment spec

    *5. (Abraham) Develope the main driver program function that is menu driven (0) to terminate and (99) 
        to output everything. This will take in a command line argument of the input file and 
        output file.
    
        *5a. (use global int variable)(solved by Abraham Avila using readFiles) Develope 
            sentence counting function. Be sure to clearly define what is a sentence and consult
            team if definition works. This covers (i) in the 
            assignment spec

        1. Did you use a .h file to achive the tasks? (e) in spec
        2. Make sure to label your section when outputing to the file
        3. Everything will be output lower case except for Section title 
        4. report runtime in nansec (exception: task 6). (j) in spec

    Percentage for each member:
    Abraham: assigned 2 tasks
    Has done tasks 1, 5. 2/2 completed = 100%.

    Ari: assigned 2 tasks
    Has done tasks 2, 4. 2/2 completed = 100%

    Thomas: assigned 2 tasks
    Has done tasks 3, 6. 2/2 completed = 100%
